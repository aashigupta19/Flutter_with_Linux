## LinuxAPI

A new Flutter project.

## Overview

This project attempts to use the database services provided by the Google Cloud Platform, i.e., Firestore.

## About the Project

This Flutter application is integrated with 2 technologies: RedHat(RHEL v8) and Firestore.

- The aim of the project is that when a user gives an input of any linux command to be executed, flutter is connected with the redhat server and command is executed on that server
- The output is stored on the Firestore Database connected to the application.
- Output of the command executed is shown on the app screen.
- Output of the entire database is shown on the console for now.

**This project is still in progress** as I'm still working on the retrieval of data from firestore and for it to be displayed on the app screen, instead of console

## Task Description
For detailed explanation of the project, I've attached one "Task Description.docx" file for reference.
